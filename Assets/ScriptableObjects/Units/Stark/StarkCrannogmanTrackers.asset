  lore: The Crannogman Trackers are never what one would call a front-line unit.
    Lightly armed and lightly armored, Trackers stand little chance in formal engagements,
    What Trackers lack in direct damage, however, they more than make up for in their
    speed and ability to disrupt and confuse ennemy formations, all the while combining
    their speed and mobility with deadly hit-and-run tactics to avoid direct engagements.
