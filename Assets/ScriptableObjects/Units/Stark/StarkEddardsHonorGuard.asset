  lore: Chosen men from House Stral's own ranks, Lord Eddard Stark's honor guard
    have proven themselves as Warriors of the highest integrity. They can be relied
    upon to hold the field against long odd, and dish out punishment as well as they
    can take it. Every man would willingly lay down his life for their lord, all
    the more so as Lord Eddard Stark would do the same. One can rely on the Honor
    Guard as a more-than-capable vanguard to any Stark force.
