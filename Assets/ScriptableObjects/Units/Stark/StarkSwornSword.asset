  lore: 'Sworn Swords are the bedrock upon which House Stark commanders base their
    strategies. Brave, capable and overwhelmingly loyal to the Direwolf banner, Sworn
    Sword would rather perish to a man than abandon brothers in battle. While perhaps
    not as well found in arms and armor as wealthier houses, these men know that
    gold alone does not a warrior make. '
